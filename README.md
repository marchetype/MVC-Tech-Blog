  ## Description
  - This project is designed to provide a space for users to share posts and interact with others who use the site. Users are allowed to create, delete, and update posts in addition to commenting on the posts of others.
  ## Installation
  - There is no installation process for this app, however, currently the deployed application is not running correctly. Until the deployment is fixed and functional, the User must run 

        mysql -u root -p

        SOURCE schema.sql

    then
  
        npm install 
    
    and 
    
        run node seeds/index.js and node server.js to start the locally deployed app.
  ## Usage
  - In order to use the app, the user must only interact with the GUI. As of now, no stylization has been added to the page but this will be implemented in further updates.
